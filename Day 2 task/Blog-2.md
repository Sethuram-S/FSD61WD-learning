<h1>Objects and Their Internal Representation</h1>

In JavaScript, objects serve as fundamental data structures. They differ from primitive data types (such as numbers, strings, and booleans) because objects can contain a combination of primitive values and reference data types. Here are some key points:

1. <b>Object Basics:</b>
    - An object is an unordered collection of related data stored as key-value pairs.
    - Each key (property) can be a variable or a function (method).
    - For example, consider an object representing a person:

<center>

</center>


2. <b>Properties and Methods:</b>
    - Properties define the characteristics of an object (e.g., name, age, courses).
    - Methods are functions associated with the object (e.g., greet).
    - You can access properties using dot notation (perso.name) or bracket notation (person ['age']).

3. <b>Internal Representation:</b>
    - JavaScript engines represent objects using data structures like hash tables.
    - Keys (property names) are hashed for efficient property access.
    - When you access a property, the engine performs a hash lookup to retrieve the value.

4. <b>Creating Objects:</b>
    - You can create objects using literal notation ({}) or the new Object() constructor.
    - Example:

</center>


5. <b>Prototypes and Inheritance:</b>
    - Every object has an associated prototype (except the root object).
    - Prototypes allow inheritance of properties and methods.
    - Constructor functions create objects with shared prototypes.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

Understanding how JavaScript represents objects internally is essential for effective programming. Whether youâ€™re building web applications or working with APIs, mastering objects empowers you to write cleaner, more maintainable code. Happy coding..!
