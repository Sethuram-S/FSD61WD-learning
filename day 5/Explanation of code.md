<h2>Decoding JavaScript Objects: Your Personal Resume Organizer</h2>

When I build my digital resume, each piece of information—my name, skills, and work experience in JavaScript objects—helps me organize them. Let’s explore the basics:

<h3>The HTML structure</h3>

Imagine your resume as a web page. The HTML file sets the stage:

- <b>`<!DOCTYPE html>`:</b> Think of this as the “resume blueprint.”
- <b>`<html>, <head>, and <body>`:</b> These create the canvas for your resume.
- <b>`<title>`:</b> Like a label on your resume folder.

<h3>The JavaScript Magic</h3>

Inside the <b>`<body>`</b>, we have a <b>`<script>`</b>-our JavaScript playground. Here, we define a variable called <b>resumeData</b>. It’s like a digital folder where we’ll store all our resume details.

<h3>What’s inside the <b>resumeData</b>?</h3>

1. <b>Name:</b> Imagine a nametag. Our resumeData has a property called name, which holds your first and last name.
2. <b>Contact Info:</b> My phone number, email, LinkedIn profile, and GitHub link—all bundled up in the contact property.
3. <b>Summary:</b> A brief intro about myself—my skills, experience, and passion.
4. <b>Education:</b> Think of this as my school or college history. Each educational institution (degree, university, graduation date) is an entry in the education array.
5. <b>Work Experience:</b> My Job History! Each job (company, title, dates, and description) is an object in the workExperience array.
6. <b>Skills:</b> A list of things good at—like a mini superpower inventory.
7. <b>Certifications:</b> Imagine these as my resume badges. Each certification (name, issuer, date) is an object in the Certifications array.

<h3>The Console Log</h3>

Finally, we peek inside our digital resume folder by using <b>console.log(resumeData)</b>. It’s like opening a folder to see everything organized.
